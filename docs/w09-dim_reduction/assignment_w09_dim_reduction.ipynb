    "# Homework 9 - Dimensionality Reduction\n",
    "In this homework, you will repeat the dimensionality reduction exploration from [class hands-on](../class) but with another dataset. And also provide your own observations of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feel free to choose your own dataset (like the one you are using for the final project), or to keep things simple, you can use the Cars dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Project Setup**:  \n",
    "   - Set up your Python and Jupyter (or VSCode) environment.  \n",
    "   - Clone or download the repository provided in class (refer to the class notes).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Choose a Dataset**:  \n",
    "   - You can use the Cars dataset or any other dataset of your choice.\n",
    "   - Ensure your dataset has multiple numeric features and at least one categorical feature for coloring.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Identify Features that numeric**:\n",
    "   - Identify which features in your dataset are numeric. You can use the `select_dtypes` method in pandas to help with this.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Choose and apply at least 2 dimensionality reduction techniques**:\n",
    "   - You can use PCA, t-SNE, UMAP, or any other dimensionality reduction technique you learned about in class or from the literature.\n",
    "   - Apply these techniques to your dataset and visualize the results.\n",
    "   - Tell us if you find any interesting patterns or clusters visually in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Documentation**:  \n",
    "   - Comment your code and add markdown explanations for each part of your analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Submission**:  \n",
    "   - Ensure your notebook is complete and all cells are executed without errors.\n",
    "   - Save your notebook and export as either PDF or HTML. If the visualizations using altair are not being shown in the html, submit a separated version with altair html. Refer to: https://altair-viz.github.io/getting_started/starting.html#publishing-your-visualization (you can use the `chart.save('chart_file.html')` method).\n",
    "   - Submit to Canvas."
